<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>In this blog post, I look into the “Ground Game,” or the non-ad components to political US House campaigns.
Primarily, I focus on Extension #2 whether expert predictions (blog post 4) and ad spending (blog post 5)
affect turnout at the district level. I end with an update to my model and a further look
into my specific district, OH-01.</p>
</div>
<div id="ads" class="section level1">
<h1>Ads</h1>
<p>To begin, I examine whether there is a relationship between expert predictions
and turnout. I run three models, as shown below, with each model adding a variable.</p>
<p>In my first model, I simply run turnout, calculated as total voters minus the district’s
eligible citizens of that age group, on the average expert prediction rating. One immediate
limitation in this data is that there were only 390 observations for which I had expert
predictions between 2010-2022, so the training dataset becomes 270 observations.
The next model also includes a variable for the status of the incumbent, and the final
model includes a variable for the presidential party.</p>

<p>As the model output shows, my first model does not find there to be a significant
relationship between the turnout and average rating. However, after controlling for incumbency,
both models 2 and 3 determine that there is a negative relationship between the two variables.
This means that as Cook predicts that a district will turn more Republican, the turnout
is predicted to be about .01 points lower. Hence, the relationship is still about neglegible.</p>
<p>Next, I created a small table with rmse and mae outputs as validation tests on my testing data.
Each of these measures is pretty similar, suggesting that even though our adjusted R^2 was much better after including incumbency data, the test data didn’t show large differences.</p>
<p>To continue looking at turnout data, I examine the relationship between total $’s
spent on ads (for districts with data) and turnout in districts between 2010 and 2022.
This leads to 770 total observations.
As this first graph shows, there appears to be a positive, but noise, correlation
between ad spending and turnout, giving beginning evidence that ad spending
is effective at mobilization. To control for midterm years, I next facet it by whether or not
the election was during a midterm year. I find that the R^2 is slightly better after
faceting, but the correlation is likely still hard to tease out without further data.

<p>Instead of going deeper into models for any of these relationships, I will return
to my existing model. Since these variables (turnout and ads) are hard to predict
ahead of time, I am going to stick to fundamental-based data in my model for now.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges has been cleaning and merging the district-level data to get a clean dataset
of past results and the 2022 races. This week, I have been working to bind historical
data to 2022 data but am encountering a few issues, including: names being formatted
in different ways, how to treat races where there are more than one party from a specific race (eg. Alaska House), and districts that have recently been drawn (eg. Colorado District 8).</p>
<p>Hence, I am going to return to my nationwide model where I am more confident that these
errors will be diluted. Here, I begin to look at seat share versus fundamental data (presidential party, house incumbency party, economic data (disposable change in income), as well as presidential and generic ballot approval ratings.</p>
